# The Hand
The Hand is an interactive installation designed, built, and exhibited in 2017 with collaborator Tong Wu. The piece was conceived as an exploration of how humans interact with humanoid machines. Can you build a machine with a personality? How would someone respond to it if you did?

## Code
1. v1 contains the original arduino files for the prototype device.
1. v2 contains the final version of The Hand, which includes support for a Leap Motion controller. All arduino code was rewritten for Node using the [Johnny Five](http://johnny-five.io/) library.
